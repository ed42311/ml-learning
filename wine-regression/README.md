# Multivariate Wine Table Regression

## Setup

You'll need `python3` and `pip`, these packages are all installed under `python3` not `python` which in the mac environment means `python 2` by default.

If you haven't played around python that much:

[Using pip 3 alongside pip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11268501/how-to-use-pip-with-python-3-x-alongside-python-2-x)

with pip3 install

```md
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn as seabornInstance
sklearn
```

There are a few files in this directory.  

```md
./
 | - wine-regression.py (actaul python file)
 | - wineMultiVar.ipynb (jupyter labs notebook file)
 | - winequality.csv (our dataset to run through and train/test sklearn)
```

The `.ipynb` file is a jupyter notebook.  If you'd like to work through and look at the notebook you will need to install [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install). Once installed you can run `$ jupyter lab` in the root level of this directory
